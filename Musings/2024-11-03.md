On a whim I'm starting this all up. This entire repo is intended be a record of anything/everything IT related that I'm working on personally and professionally.

I am utilizing Obsidian + Markdown language to write + sync between various computers I use. Obsidian community plug-ins I've installed so far: dataview, calendar, git, style settings, tasks and media extended.

I am currently working on a [[DNS Server]] project as prof of concept and understanding of DNS.
